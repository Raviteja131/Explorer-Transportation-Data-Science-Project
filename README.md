# Explorer-Transportation-Data-Science-Project

Project Overview:
We analyzed over 10 million records from the Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset to enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists across New York City's boroughs.      

Tools & Methodology:
Data Analysis: Utilized Python librariesâ€”Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and Folium for interactive maps.

Platform: Employed Google Colab for managing and analyzing the extensive dataset.

Key Findings:

Peak Crash Times: Fridays, especially during evening rush hours, have the highest number of collisions.

High-Risk Areas: Certain intersections are frequent hotspots for pedestrian and cyclist accidents.

Recommendations:
Infrastructure Enhancements: Implement better lighting, protected bike lanes, and advanced pedestrian crossings in high-risk areas.
Enforcement: Increase traffic law enforcement to protect all road users.
This project highlighted the vital role of data science in public safety and provided actionable insights to make NYC streets safer.
